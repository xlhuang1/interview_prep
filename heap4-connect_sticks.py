# Youâ€™re given an array sticks where each value represents the length of a stick.
# You can connect any two sticks:
# The cost is equal to the sum of their lengths
# The resulting stick has that new length
# You can repeat this until there is only one stick
# ðŸ‘‰ Return the minimum total cost to connect all sticks.

# optimal solution - use a min heap and always connect the two smallest sticks O(n log n) time
